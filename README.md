# Multithreaded-Web-Server
This project implements a multithreaded HTTP web server in Rust with a custom thread pool. It handles multiple client connections concurrently by reusing a fixed number of worker threads, improving performance compared to spawning a new thread for every request.

---

## âœ… Features

- Handles HTTP requests on `127.0.0.1:7878`
- Routes:
  - `/` â†’ Returns `hello.html`
  - `/sleep` â†’ Simulates slow response (5s delay)
  - Any other path â†’ Returns `404.html`
- **Custom Thread Pool** for concurrent request handling
- **Graceful Shutdown** after serving 2 connections
- Logs worker activity for clarity

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works

- **TCP Listener** accepts incoming connections on `127.0.0.1:7878`
- Each connection is submitted as a **job** to the **thread pool**
- Workers pick up jobs from the channel and execute them
- After processing **2 connections**, the server shuts down because take(2) is Initalized for Optimization.
- Thread pool ensures a **graceful exit** by joining all worker threads

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-multithreaded-webserver.git
```
### 2. Direct to the folder
```bash
cd rust-multithreaded-webserver
```
### 3. Build & Run

## Test in Browser
- http://127.0.0.1:7878/ â†’ Loads hello.html
- http://127.0.0.1:7878/sleep â†’ Waits 5 seconds, then loads hello.html
- Any other path â†’ 404.html
